# Privacy Policy

**Last update date: June 29, 2024**

This policy applies to personal information collected through this website. 

A privacy policy for our single player game is accessible [here]({{site.url}}/info/SinglePlayerPrivacyPolicy).

A privacy policy for our multiplayer game is accessible [here]({{site.url}}/info/MultiPlayerPrivacyPolicy).

## Information we collect

When you use this site, we collect much less information than perhaps is usual on the internet.

We use an analytics service provided by cloudflare. The data this service initially collects includes IP addresses, basic information about your device, the specific pages you view on our site, and the website that referred you. This is used to generate aggregate information about site traffic.

To protect your privacy, the IP and device information are not stored alongside the data about your browsing activity, and at the time of writing are discarded within 24 hours except where implicated in DDoS attacks or other abuse of the service; pseudo-anonymised data is retained for around 48 hours. You can read about how cloudflare processes information on their site.

## Information usage

We use information collected on this website to understand how the site is used and how people find it.

## Information disclosure

1. We may disclose the information we collect to any member of our existing or future group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries
2. We may disclose the information we collect to third parties in the following circumstances:
   1. In the event that we sell any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the buyer of such business or assets
   2. If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us about our customers will be a transferred asset
   3. If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms; or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our customers or of others
   4. We may share the anonymised, aggregated information we collect for industry analysis ad other purposes. However, this does not include personal information
3. We will not use your information for third party marketing purposes

## Data security

The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your personal information but we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Services â€” any transmission is at your own risk.

We will use procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access to your information.

## Changes to our privacy policy

Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, brought to your attention via email. We will indicate the changes clearly.
