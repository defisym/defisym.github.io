# Multi Player Privacy Policy

**Last update date: June 29, 2024**

This privacy policy forms part of an agreement between you and irregulars (referred to in these terms as "irregulars", "we", "our" and "us") and applies to your use of its database, websites and other channels and technologies; when this privacy policy mentions "StoryNexus" or "the Service", this includes all of these things.

## Introduction

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how our website collects, uses, discloses and protects your information.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand how we will treat your information.

We recognise we have a special obligation to protect personal information we obtain from children. We do not and will not knowingly collect information from any unsupervised child under the age of 13.

In certain countries, prior written permission or other verifiable consent may also be required from a parent or guardian for children under the age of 18.

## The data controller

For data collection purposes, the data controller is irregulars, a doujin group from China cooperate through internet.

- We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them

We may collect this data through our Services or third party services connected with them.

We may store the data that we collect from you on servers outside the EU. It may also be processed by staff operating outside of the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the performance of our obligations from any contracts entered into with you and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy, and will only share it with partners committed to GDPR compliance.

## Cookies

Some are essential for these sites to work — without cookies, you wouldn't be able to log in.
